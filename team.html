                  David is a computer science major from Montgomery High School pursuing certificates in computational biology and machine learning. He competed in Science Olympiad for six lovely years with the Montgomery Middle School and High School teams. David has supervised events at many tournaments, including Green Generation at the 2016 MIT Invitational, and is now passionate about contributing his experiences to raise the level of Science Olympiad tournaments nationwide. In high school, David directed New Jerseyâ€™s first invitational tournament in history. Last year, he co-founded and directed the first ever Princeton University Science Olympiad Invitational. This year, David is excited to advise Princeton University Science Olympiad in its second year. On campus, David also directs HackPrinceton, plays club table tennis, and occasionally practices his clarinet...

He competed in Science Olympiad for six years and led the WW-P North team to nationals during his senior year. His extensive experience competing in ecology-related events inspired a love of plants, and he now enjoys escaping to the outdoors. After starting and co-directing Princeton's inaugural invitational, he hopes to use his experience to help the newly expanded team run its best tournament yet!

                  Bill is currently a junior majoring in Mathematics, but knows a surprising amount of Earth Science. He is still salty (and probably will always be) about choking Experimental Design at states, but still has plenty of fond memories (and lots of medals) from his years of Science Olympiad with West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South. If he's running your event, chances are the test will be rather difficult, so be prepared :) In his free time, he enjoys swimming (which comes with great pregames) and playing piano, but usually ends up wasting all of it on Steam. Last year, Bill was the event supervisor for Astronomy.

Last year, Reilly served as the Head Event Supervisor for Chemistry Lab, and he is really looking forward to serving as the Logistics Director for next year's competition! Although he has no idea what he wants to do with his life, Reilly's passion for computer science has driven him to pursue a BSE COS degree, which he supplements with studies related to his other passions such as music, physics, and Latin. Outside of class, Reilly loves watching movies, eating good food (especially sushi), and â€” above all else â€” playing percussion in the fantastic Princeton University Orchestra!

In her free time, Audrey enjoys playing piano and clarinet, occasionally composing music or drawing, and questioning her major choice."

                  Ariel is a sophomore interested in Computer Science department and potentially pursuing the Quantitative and Computational Biology certificate. She participated in Science Bowl throughout high school, but don't worry, she's seen the light and joined Science Olympiad. Though her home state of Texas will always be her favorite, New Jersey has grown on her.
                  When not in class or lab, she enjoys running and pretending that her store-bought cookie dough is actually from scratch.

Aside from judicial politics and American jurisprudence, he also enjoys chemistry, biophysics, data analysis, and learning new languages. Outside of Science Olympiad at Princeton, Akhil is a part of Model Congress, Army ROTC, the James Madison Program, Outdoor Action, and the Tory. Akhil speaks seven languages and is the ideal companion for any international trip :) Last year, Akhil supervised the Chem Lab event with Reilly and is excited to make this year's tournament even better!

He now aims to make the build event experience at Princeton University Invitational as great as it can be, and hopes that more students can be inspired to try their hand at engineering. Along with David, he redesigned the entire site this past summer and hopes that you like it :)
